## The Problem
<br>

In September 2019 I moved to Bilbao in Spain. <br>
During my time there I wanted to learn as much Spanish as I could. <br>
For me, to learn anything, it's the most effective to have my own learning material.
And while there are plenty of good learning apps like Duolingo, they
While language learning apps like Duolingo can work great to get started learning a language, it didn't completely meet my requirements.

After using this for a while, I really started to like this way of learning.
I could import any texts I liked reading and quickly translate any words.

Then the matter of your texts and flashcards.
Because it is an open-source project, the creator did not have the money to pay for a database.
This means that the only way to use LWT is to have it on your pc and run it with a local server.
While this is not too big of a hassle, it doesn't make for a very easy-to-use piece of software.
And it also doesn't allow for practicing all of your texts and flashcards across devices.

## The Solution

While I was learning Spanish, I had already started learning Vue.
So, with some of the skills I learned before, I set out to create my own web app that can solve all of the problems I mentioned before.

To save me a lot of time and frustration I had to pick the right tech stack.
In the years before, I had learned how to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I had a good basis to start from.
And
