### Selling custom wooden chests 
At Vermeshoeve, they make custom wooden chests for a wide variety of customers.<br>
What they needed was a website where they could show off their experience and products to potential customers. <br>
So first we sat down and talked about what they expected from the website and what kind of designs they liked.<br>
They wanted a simple website, without bells and whistles, to enable customers to contact them easily.<br>
Furthermore, they wanted to be able to maintain their own website and add content when it came available.<br> 
This is why I build the website using Wordpress.<br>
WordPress is great for websites that can be easily maintained and updated by the customer..<br>
 
### Website Design 
Since Vermeshoeve had a small budget, I chose for a simple WordPress theme.<br>
It displays the information in a straightforward manner with a big emphasis on pictures, so customers could get a good idea of what their products look like. 
 
### Logo Design 
Vermeshoeve didnâ€™t have their own logo yet.<br>
Since they work (almost) exclusively with wood, I wanted their logo to represent this.<br>
When they showed me some of their work where they burned logos into their wooden chests, I loved the way it looked.<br>
That is exactly why their logo looks like the letters have been burned onto a piece of wood.<br>
With the use of Photoshop, I created their current logo. 

<br>

<br>
<br>


As for their favicon, I wanted to keep the same style but make it better visible when it is seen in the browser.

### Yoast SEO 
To make sure that their customers could find the website on search engines, I used the Yoast SEO plugin. <br>
Yoast SEO makes it simple to check the texts for good SEO keywords and shows you where you should add or change content.<br>
It is important to note that although Yoast SEO helps with getting a better SEO rating, it is not as good as having an SEO expert write the content and do research for the best keywords.<br>
 
### The result 
At Vermeshoeve they are very happy with the result.<br>
They even put a big printed version of their logo next to their driveway.<br>

Over the last years, it has helped them gain clients and increase their customer base.
